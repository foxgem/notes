**Overview:** This article by MixBytes security researchers Dmitry Zakharov and Sergey Boogerwooger addresses the limitations of relying solely on code coverage and the "hacker mindset" for Web3 protocol audits. It introduces a structured testing framework based on three mindsets: hacker, invariant (formal verification), and system architect. The framework aims to guide developers in creating more effective tests that can uncover severe bugs and vulnerabilities by considering access control, function call sequences, input parameter constraints, unbreakable conditions, and potential failures of external integrations. The article emphasizes that while high test coverage is important, it's not sufficient for ensuring protocol security and resilience.

**分节阅读:**

*   **Introduction:** The introduction highlights the inadequacy of 100% code coverage as a security measure and the difficulty of implementing a "hacker mindset." It introduces a structured testing framework using three mindsets to help developers write more effective tests. The framework aims to catch severe bugs by adopting hacker, invariant, and system architect perspectives.
*   **The Testing Framework Overview:** This section presents the audit process as a series of questions about the code. It emphasizes that the framework should be applied after basic unit and integration tests. The framework helps ensure the protocol functions correctly and is free of vulnerabilities.
*   **Hacker Mindset:** This section provides specific questions to guide developers in writing meaningful tests using the hacker mindset. It focuses on identifying potential attack vectors caused by poor access management and unrestricted user actions. The questions address use cases, function call sequences, input parameters, and parameters that should not be user-controlled.
*   **Invariant Mindset:** This section focuses on identifying unbreakable conditions, or invariants, within the code. It emphasizes the importance of having a detailed protocol specification or a list of critical invariants. Fuzzing techniques and formal verification methods can be used to validate invariants.
*   **System Architect Mindset:** This section takes a pessimistic view of protocol integrations with external services. It considers potential failures, updates, or compromises of integrated services or protocols. The mindset encourages anticipating how external integrations could fail and creating mocks for off-chain services.
*   **Conclusion:** The conclusion reiterates that high test coverage alone doesn't guarantee safety. It summarizes the key questions for each mindset and emphasizes the importance of writing thoughtful, targeted tests. The article encourages developers to adopt the hacker, invariant, and system architect mindsets to uncover vulnerabilities.
