**Keywords:** AI SDK, LLMs, React, Next.js, Templates

**Overview:**

The AI SDK is a TypeScript toolkit designed to simplify the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into applications built with frameworks like React, Next.js, Vue, and Node.js. It offers a unified API for text generation, structured object creation, and tool calling, along with framework-agnostic hooks for building chat and generative UIs. The SDK supports multiple model providers and offers templates to help developers quickly start AI-powered applications. It also provides access to the entire AI SDK documentation in Markdown format, which can be used to prompt LLMs with questions about the AI SDK based on the most up-to-date documentation.

**Section-by-Section Breakdown:**

*   **Why use the AI SDK?:** Integrating LLMs into applications is complex and provider-dependent. The AI SDK offers a unified API for text generation, structured objects, and tool calls. It also provides framework-agnostic hooks for building chat and generative user interfaces.
*   **Model Providers:** The AI SDK supports various model providers, including OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, Google Generative AI, Google Vertex AI, Mistral, x.AI Grok, Together.ai, Cohere, Fireworks, DeepInfra, DeepSeek, Cerebras, Groq and Perplexity. Each provider offers different capabilities like image input, object generation, tool usage, and streaming.
